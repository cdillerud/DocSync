# GPI Document Hub - Changelog

## March 15, 2026 — Technical Debt Remediation Pass (iter_102)

### Entrypoint Consolidation
- `main.py` is the single authoritative FastAPI app (confirmed by supervisor: `uvicorn main:app`)
- `server.py` converted to library: removed `app = FastAPI(...)`, all `app.include_router()`, `app.add_middleware()`, `@app.on_event()` decorators, and health check endpoint
- `server_new.py` deleted (was unused)

### Routing Consolidation
- Migrated `routes/auth.py` → `routers/auth.py`
- Migrated `routes/ap_review.py` → `routers/ap_review.py` (prefix: `/api/ap-review` → `/ap-review`)
- Migrated `routes/spiro.py` → `routers/spiro.py` (prefix: `/api/spiro` → `/spiro`)
- Deleted unused: `routes/config.py`, `routes/dashboard.py`, `routes/documents.py`, `routes/ingestion.py`, `routes/workflows.py`
- All 37+ routers now under `routers/` (single convention)

### Canonical Document Pipeline
- Created `services/pipeline/document_pipeline.py`
- 7 stages: classification, entity_resolution, transaction_match, bundle_detection, lifecycle_check, policy_decision, learning_capture
- API: `POST /api/document-intelligence/pipeline/{doc_id}`, `GET /api/document-intelligence/pipeline/stages`

### Architecture Documentation
- Created `ARCHITECTURE_CURRENT.md` at repo root

### Testing
- 16/16 backend tests passed — all API contracts preserved
- Test report: `/app/test_reports/iteration_102.json`
