# GPI Document Hub - Changelog

## [2026-04-18g] v2.4.1 — Phase U1: Unified Event Log (Shared Plumbing)

### Context
Audit of the codebase surfaced 3 parallel event collections (`intake_learning_events`, `posting_learning_events`, `learning_events`) and 4 separate schedulers across AP + intake sides — the "AI Learning" and "Intake Learning" tabs are mirror images of each other but the underlying plumbing never consolidated. Started shared-plumbing refactor with the highest-ROI piece first: a canonical cross-domain event log.

### Added
- **`services/learning_core/`** package — new home for shared plumbing
- **`learning_core.events_service`** with `record_event()`, `list_events()`, `get_domain_summary()`; writes to `learning_events_v2` with indexes auto-created on (domain, created_at), (scope_type, scope_value, created_at), (event_type, created_at)
- **Schema**: `{id, domain, event_type, actor, scope_type, scope_value, target, applied, extra, source, created_at}` — scope_type polymorphic across `vendor`/`customer`/`xls_staging`/`global`
- **`routers/learning_core.py`** — 2 new endpoints:
  - `GET /api/learning/events` (filter by domain/type/scope/time)
  - `GET /api/learning/events/summary` (dashboard aggregates)
- **Dual-write** wired into 3 callsites:
  - `intake_learning_feedback_service.record_feedback_event` (Phase D feedback)
  - `cold_start_matcher_service.promote_inherited_suggestion` (Phase E promotions)
  - `draft_feedback_service._record_feedback_events` (AP draft BC feedback)
- Legacy collections still receive writes during the 30-day migration window — zero risk.

### Not in U1 (planned for v2.5.0+)
- U2 — Shared TF-IDF fingerprint service (merge vendor + customer similarity)
- U3 — Shared pattern-health service + unified hygiene scheduler
- U4 — Unified feedback ingest endpoint (`POST /api/learning/feedback`)
- U5 — Shared `<PatternHealthPanel>` React component
- U6 — Retire duplicate sales_order_learning_* service family

### Verified
- 33/33 pytest unit tests pass (5 new + 28 existing)
- New test `test_intake_feedback_dual_writes_to_learning_core` proves dual-write lands in both collections
- Live `GET /api/learning/events/summary` returns clean shape with zero events (nothing triggered yet in this environment)
- Lint: all checks passed
- Backend restarts clean; no regressions

### Version
- Bumped `APP_VERSION` to **2.4.1** in `/app/frontend/src/lib/version.js`



## [2026-04-18f] v2.4.0 — Phase E: Cold-Start Peer Matching

### Goal
Continue the "AI keeps tuning" thread from v2.3.0. Brand-new customers start with zero BC history, so the learning is cold — no suggested lines, no bounds, no guidance for the reviewer. Fix that by automatically finding the most similar known customer and offering their patterns as "inherited suggestions" that can be promoted to the new customer's own pattern with one click.

### Added
- **`services/cold_start_matcher_service.py`** — pure-python TF-IDF fingerprint matcher:
  - `build_fingerprint()` / `get_or_build_fingerprint()` / `invalidate_fingerprint()` / `rebuild_all_fingerprints()` — TTL-cached in `intake_customer_fingerprints` (24h)
  - `find_similar_customers()` — cosine-similarity against all known fingerprints, returns top-K with matched-token receipts
  - `promote_inherited_suggestion()` — reviewer-driven; seeds a real pattern on the target customer and records an `inherited_suggestion_promoted` audit event
  - Tokenizer keeps SKU-style tokens (`C-9874-10001833`) intact, drops stopwords/pure-numbers/short-tokens
- **Wired into `sales_intake_learning_service`** at 3 cold-start branches (unresolved customer, resolved-no-history, XLS staging). Result surfaces as `intake_insights.peer_matches`.
- **Fingerprint auto-invalidation** on every pattern feedback (accept/reject/promote) so cold-start matches stay fresh.
- **3 new endpoints**: `POST /api/intake/insights/promote-inherited`, `POST /api/intake/learning/rebuild-fingerprints`, `GET /api/intake/learning/similar-customers`.
- **Frontend**: `IntakeLearningPanel` renders a new purple "Peer-matched suggestions" block right after the cold-start notice, with matched-token pills + one-click ArrowUpRight promote buttons.
- **28/28 pytest unit tests passing** (9 new + 8 feedback + 11 intake).
- **Testing agent iter 213: 100% backend (39/39) + 100% frontend. Giovanni state stayed pristine.**

### Design notes
Chose pure-python TF-IDF over LLM embeddings deliberately:
- Dataset is tiny (≤200 customers × ~100 tokens)
- Domain vocabulary is sparse and highly discriminative (SKU prefixes like `C-9874` are natural TF-IDF gold)
- Deterministic → reviewers can literally see which tokens matched
- Zero API cost, zero network dep, zero sklearn bloat

### Version
- Bumped `APP_VERSION` to **2.4.0** in `/app/frontend/src/lib/version.js`.



## [2026-04-18e] v2.3.0 — Phase D: Learning Feedback Loop

### Goal
User: *"I want the AI to keep tuning and getting better — that is the best ROI."*

Turn every reviewer click into training data so pattern confidence adapts in real time.

### Added
- **`services/intake_learning_feedback_service.py`** — new service with:
  - `record_feedback_event()` — 6 event types (suggestion_accepted / suggestion_rejected / bounds_violation_confirmed / bounds_violation_overridden / unmatched_item_confirmed_new / unmatched_item_mapped)
  - Pattern mutations: accepts bump `occurrences` + `frequency`, rejects decay them, acceptance <40% over ≥5 samples → `retired=true`, ≥90% → `trusted=true`
  - Bounds overrides widen `qty_history.std_dev` by 10% per override
  - Unmatched items seed `intake_item_candidates` / `intake_item_aliases` collections
  - `get_pattern_health()` — dashboard aggregation (trusted / drifting / retired / unscored counts, per-customer drill-down, recent events feed)
  - `run_pattern_hygiene()` — nightly safety-net pass
- **4 new endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/intake/insights/feedback`
  - `GET /api/intake/learning/pattern-health`
  - `POST /api/intake/learning/hygiene`
  - `GET /api/intake/learning/events`
- **Nightly hygiene scheduler** in `server.py` (24h interval, 10-min startup delay)
- **`IntakeLearningPanel`** — inline ThumbsUp / ThumbsDown / Check buttons on every suggestion, bounds violation, and unmatched item. One-click state transitions to "kept ✓" / "dropped" / "new ✓".
- **`IntakeLearningPage`** — new Pattern Health panel: 4 trust-state counters, per-customer table, 72h reviewer-feedback activity feed. "Pattern hygiene" button for on-demand cleanup.
- **Version** bumped to **v2.3.0** in `/app/frontend/src/lib/version.js`.

### Verified live
- Giovanni C-10250 has 16 learned patterns. Accepting OIPALLET moved occurrences 15 → 16, frequency → 100%. 5 rejects of OITIERSHEET correctly retired it (retired count 0 → 1 on `/pattern-health`).
- 19/19 pytest unit tests pass (8 new + 11 existing)
- Testing agent iter 212: 100% backend (19/19 unit + 14/14 API) + 100% frontend (Pattern Health panel, feedback buttons, hygiene flow all verified). Zero issues.



## [2026-04-18d] v2.2.1 — Phase B (De-pilotization) + Phase C (Doc Detail Panel)

### Phase B — De-pilotized UI framing
The Inside Sales Pilot is now part of the overall hub, not a feature flag. Renamed the user-facing labels:
- Tab `Inside Sales Pilot` → `Sales Intake` (`SalesInventoryHubPage.js:19`)
- Page header `Inside Sales Pilot` → `Sales Intake` (`InsideSalesPilotPage.js:222`)
- Stat cards `Pilot Docs` → `Intake Docs` (InsideSalesPilotPage + SpiroBCCrossRefDashboard)
- Disabled banner `Pilot is disabled` → `Sales intake polling is disabled`
- Corpus comparison column `Inside Sales Pilot` → `Sales Intake`

Backend endpoints + DB fields intentionally preserved (`/api/inside-sales-pilot/*`, `inside_sales_pilot: true`, `sales_pilot_extraction`, `pilot_mailbox`) to avoid regression. Only the human-facing labels were neutralized.

### Phase C — IntakeLearningPanel on every Document Detail page
- `DocumentDetailPage.js` now renders `IntakeLearningPanel` directly below `ReadinessPanel` (around line 820), so every doc shows its BC/Spiro insights the moment it's opened. No more drawer-digging.
- Component is the same one used in the XLS staging drawer — single source of truth.

### Version
- Bumped `APP_VERSION` to **2.2.1** in `/app/frontend/src/lib/version.js`.

### Verified
- 11/11 pytest unit tests pass
- Testing agent: 100% backend + 100% frontend, zero issues, zero action items (iteration_211.json)



## [2026-04-18c] BC Write-Back Auto-Refresh Hook

### Problem
Daily scheduler (added in 2026-04-18b) was time-based — a user posting a sales order to BC would wait up to 24h before the hub learned the fresh pattern. Tight feedback loop requested.

### Added
- **`refresh_customer_after_bc_write(customer_no)`** — fire-and-forget service that re-learns patterns for a single customer the instant their BC sales order is posted successfully. Errors are swallowed so the main BC-write path is never blocked.
- **Hook in `gpi_integration.create_sales_order_from_document`** — on `result["success"]=True`, spawns an `asyncio.create_task` to refresh that customer's patterns in the background.
- **AP invoices intentionally excluded** — they already run `posting_pattern_analyzer.learn_from_posting` at the same callsite, which is the AP-side equivalent (vendor-based, not customer-based). The Giovanni pattern is a sales-side concept.

### Verified
- 11/11 unit tests pass (3 new tests covering happy path, empty customer skip, error swallowing)
- Live `/api/intake/learning/refresh-active` manual endpoint still works
- Backend restarts clean; hook is a no-op when BC write fails so no regression risk



## [2026-04-18b] Daily Intake Learning Refresh Scheduler

### Problem
Phase A shipped the orchestrator but required manual `backfill` calls to pick up new BC posted orders. Nikki would post a batch of Giovanni orders to BC, but the hub wouldn't re-learn until someone clicked "Force re-run all."

### Added
- **`refresh_active_customers()`** — discovers customers with BC posted-order activity in the last N hours (via `bc_reference_cache` timestamps), re-runs `learn_from_bc_posted_orders`, then re-runs `run_intake_learning` on their open hub docs + pending XLS staging. Read-only.
- **Daily scheduler** in `server.py` — fires once every 24h (5-min startup delay). Configurable via `INTAKE_LEARNING_INTERVAL_SECONDS` and `INTAKE_LEARNING_LOOKBACK_HOURS`.
- **`POST /api/intake/learning/refresh-active`** — manual trigger with `lookback_hours` + `max_customers` + `refresh_docs` query params.

### Verified
- 8/8 unit tests pass (2 new tests for the refresh function)
- Live curl: `POST /api/intake/learning/refresh-active?lookback_hours=720` returned empty result cleanly (no BC activity in sandbox)
- Backend log confirms scheduler registered: `Intake Learning Refresh scheduler started (interval: 24h)`



## [2026-04-18] Intake Learning — Hub-wide Giovanni Pattern (Phase A)

### Problem
The Giovanni/Nikki blanket-PO learning (customer C-10250) — product-level
dunnage patterns, customer-level recurring lines (Energy Surcharge),
±2σ quantity bounds — only fired inside Sales-Order preflight. Every
other PO, sales order, AP invoice, freight invoice, and inventory XLS
ingested by the hub silently bypassed it. User asked to generalize it
so every ingest gets the same BC + Spiro learning treatment.

### Added
- **`services/sales_intake_learning_service.py`** — Orchestrator that runs
  the Giovanni pipeline (seed → suggest → bounds check → item catalog)
  on any hub doc or XLS staging record. Stores `intake_insights` on the
  document, never writes to BC.
- **`routers/intake_learning.py`** — New router with 6 endpoints:
  `GET /api/intake/learning/summary`,
  `POST /api/intake/learning/backfill`,
  `POST /api/intake/learning/run/{doc_id}`,
  `POST /api/intake/learning/run-xls/{staging_id}`,
  `GET /api/intake/insights/{doc_id}`,
  `GET /api/intake/insights-xls/{staging_id}`,
  `GET /api/intake/flagged`.
- **`unified_validation_service`** — Added `intake_learning` stage; runs for
  pilot_sales, sales_order, ap_invoice, purchase_order policies.
- **`document_readiness_service.evaluate_and_persist`** — Post-readiness hook
  fires learning for every in-scope doc_type, so every doc the hub
  processes picks up BC history automatically.
- **`inventory_xls_staging_service.stage_import`** — Runs learning inline on
  every new staging record (before auto-approve gate).
- **Frontend**: `IntakeLearningPage` at `/intake/learning` (hub-wide KPIs,
  top customers by learning coverage, flagged-for-review list, backfill
  buttons). `IntakeLearningPanel` drop-in component wired into the
  InventoryImportsPage staging drawer. Nav link added.
- **Cold-start transparency**: When a customer is extracted but no BC
  history exists, `intake_insights.cold_start=true` + a clear
  `cold_start_reason` is stored and rendered with a blue info tile so
  reviewers see "no BC learning yet" instead of silence.

### Verified
- 24/24 backend tests pass (6 unit + 18 API via testing subagent)
- Live backfill processed 6 hub docs + 50 XLS staging records; 39
  actionable findings correctly flagged
- Zero regressions on existing endpoints (pilot, inventory-xls, inventory
  health, sales-order preflight)

### Next
- Phase B — remove the "pilot" framing from UI/API labels and migrate to
  canonical `/intake/*` terminology across the hub
- Phase C — surface `intake_insights` on the individual Document Detail
  page (not just XLS staging drawer)



## [2026-04-17] Round 5 — Filename-Aware Customer Suggestion

### Problem
Brokers (like Gamer Packaging) email inventory reports for their downstream customers. Files like `Gamer Inventory Summary - Water Barons.xlsx` were being auto-suggested as the **sender** (Gamer) instead of the **actual inventory owner** (Water Barons) named in the filename.

### Fixed — 3-tier suggestion cascade in `suggest_customer_workspace`
1. **Filename suffix pattern**: `... - <Customer>.xlsx` → extracts `<Customer>` → matches against registered workspaces (name or code, bidirectional prefix match).
2. **Filename prefix pattern**: `<Customer>. <Vendor> ...xlsx` or `<Customer> <Vendor> ...` where `<Vendor>` ∈ known broker tokens (gamer, pretium, mrp, ompi, ball, lagersmith). Extracts tokens BEFORE the vendor marker.
3. **Sender domain** (priority 3, previous default): used only when filename parsing yields no match.

### Added helpers
- `_resolve_customer_text(text, customers)` — normalized bidirectional match (strips punctuation, case-insensitive, ≥3 char minimum, prefers exact/prefix over substring).

### Added endpoint & UI
- `POST /api/inventory-xls/staging/re-suggest-customers?only_unassigned=false` — re-runs the new logic on existing `pending_review` staging rows. Returns `{updated, total_pending, changed: [{staging_id, filename, new_customer}]}`.
- New UI button **"Re-suggest Customers"** (violet, `Sparkles` icon) in `/inventory/imports` header. One click re-resolves all pending stagings to their correct customer via filename parsing.

### Verified
- Live E2E on 6 test patterns:
  - `Gamer Inventory Summary - Water Barons.xlsx` → **Water Barons** ✅
  - `Ryl Co Inventory vs Ryl Co Needs.xlsx` → **Ryl Co** ✅
  - `Ryl Co. Gamer Can Forecast.xlsx` (broker pattern) → **Ryl Co** (not Gamer) ✅
  - `Coloplast On Hold Orders.xlsx` → **Coloplast** ✅
  - `Gamer Can Forecast.xlsx` (no downstream) → **Gamer** (fallback to sender) ✅
  - `open_orders_report_17-APR-26.xlsx` → Pretium (via sender when no filename hint) ✅



## [2026-04-17] Round 4 — Description Fallback + Manual Mapping Editor

### Bug fix: "0 rows" on Ryl Co Inventory files
- **Root cause**: Spreadsheets like `Ryl Co Inventory vs Ryl Co Needs 4.17.26.xlsx` have a `Description` column but no dedicated SKU/Item column. Mapper tagged Description→item_description, then every row failed with "missing item".
- **Fix** (`inventory_xls_parser.py`):
  - If `item` is unmapped but `item_description` IS mapped, `normalize_rows` falls back to using description as the item identifier (legitimate for inventory summaries).
  - Heuristic mapper no longer reports `missing_required: item` when description is mapped.
  - Item string capped at 120 chars to keep ledger clean.

### Bug fix: `\binventory\b` missing underscored filenames
- Changed to `(^|[\s_\-.])inventory($|[\s_\-.])` so `Ryl_Co_Inventory.xlsx` matches.

### Added: Manual column-map editor in UI
- `pages/InventoryImportsPage.js` — side-drawer now has an **Edit** button next to the column map. Opens dropdowns for every canonical field with options from the staged headers.
- **Save Mapping** calls `POST /api/inventory-xls/staging/{id}/update` with the new mapping, THEN automatically calls `POST /api/inventory-xls/staging/{id}/re-normalize` to re-run row normalization against the new map — no re-upload needed.

### Added: `POST /api/inventory-xls/staging/{id}/re-normalize`
- Recovers original file bytes from `hub_documents` (via `source_doc_id` or file_hash match), re-parses, and re-runs `normalize_rows` with the current column_map. Returns parsed/error counts.

### Fixed: Approval UX for 0-row staging
- UI blocks Approve when `row_count == 0` with explanatory message pointing user to fix the column map.
- Backend approval errors now surface the first error's actual text instead of "undefined".

### Verified
- Live: `Ryl_Co_Inventory_test.xlsx` with only Description + Available columns → staged with 3/3 rows, item populated from description.
- Manual editor UI: dropdowns rendered, Save Mapping triggers re-normalize automatically.
- Classification fix: filename with underscores now matches correctly.



## [2026-04-17] Round 3 — Learning-Backed Automation + Drift Alarm

### Added — Auto-approve gate
- `services/inventory_xls_staging_service.py` — `_should_auto_approve(staging_doc)` checks: assigned_customer ≠ null + rows present + column_map.source=="learned" + confidence ≥ 0.95 + learned `approval_count ≥ 3`. When all true, `stage_import` immediately calls `approve_staging` with `approved_by="auto:learned-mapping"`.
- `services/inventory_xls_parser.py` — learned confidence formula updated to `min(0.99, 0.80 + 0.05 * approval_count)`. Thus 1→0.85, 2→0.90, 3→0.95 (auto threshold), 4→0.99.
- Response shape now includes `auto_applied: bool` on `/ingest`; staging record carries `auto_approved: true` flag.

### Added — Ingest-time XLS side-channel in pilot enrichment
- `server.py :: _maybe_stage_inventory_xls(doc_id)` is called from `_run_pilot_enrichment` after BC validation + Spiro + SO rules. For every pilot-ingested `.xlsx/.xls/.csv`, runs the classifier → if inventory, auto-stages via `stage_import` (which may auto-approve per the gate above). Marks source doc with `inventory_xls_backfilled=true` to prevent re-runs.

### Added — Bulk backfill endpoint
- `POST /api/inventory-xls/backfill-pilot-docs?dry_run=true|false&limit=N` — scans all pilot-ingested XLS/CSV docs in `hub_documents` and either reports (dry_run) or stages them. Idempotent via `inventory_xls_backfilled` marker. Returns per-doc trace + classification breakdown.

### Added — Cache Drift Alarm (frontend)
- `InsideSalesPilotPage.js :: MatchTierDonut` now renders an amber alarm banner when matched ≥ 10 AND (`exact/matched < 0.80` OR `fuzzy/matched > 0.10`). Turns the donut from a passive metric into an active safety signal for extraction or BC-cache drift.

### Added — Inventory Imports sidebar nav + backfill UI
- `components/Layout.js` — new "Inventory Imports" sidebar entry (FileSpreadsheet icon).
- `pages/InventoryImportsPage.js` — "Scan Pilot XLS" (dry run) + "Backfill Pilot XLS" buttons with a rich result card showing scanned / inventory / staged / already_staged / skipped / errors + by-classification breakdown.

### Fixed — Customer auto-suggest prefix match
- `suggest_customer_workspace` — bidirectional prefix match. Previous regex failed when the sender domain was LONGER than the customer code (e.g. `gamerpackaging` sender, `gamer` code). Now tests both `code.startsWith(hint)` AND `hint.startsWith(code)` with 3-char minimum code length to avoid false positives.

### Verified
- `testing_agent_v3_fork` iteration 208: **37/37 tests passed (17 new + 20 regression), 0 issues.**
- Live E2E: 3 human approvals of same `(domain, header_hash)` → 4th file from same domain **auto-applied in one shot** with `created_by: auto:learned-mapping`.
- Docs: `/app/BACKFILL_PILOT_XLS.md`, `/app/DEPLOY_INVENTORY_XLS.md`.



## [2026-04-17] Inventory XLS Inference Pipeline — Phases A+B+C+D

### Added — Phase A (Classifier)
- `services/inventory_xls_classifier.py` — `classify_xls(filename, headers, sender_email) → XlsClassification`. Rule-based detector for 6 inventory doc types with filename + header signals, confidence scoring, and filename+header agreement bonus.

### Added — Phase B (Column Mapper + Row Normalizer)
- `services/inventory_xls_parser.py`:
  - `build_column_map` — cascade: learned → heuristic → LLM (Claude Haiku via Emergent LLM Key).
  - `normalize_rows` — applies column_map, parses dates/numbers, skips zero-qty/missing-item rows.
  - `compute_header_hash` — stable sha256[:16] over sorted-normalized headers (shared across services).
  - `extract_effective_date_from_filename` — detects "As Of" dates in filenames.

### Added — Phase C (Staging + Approval)
- `services/inventory_xls_staging_service.py` — stage_import / update_staging / approve_staging / reject_staging / suggest_customer_workspace.
- `routers/inventory_xls.py` — 8 REST endpoints under `/api/inventory-xls/`:
  - `POST /ingest` (multipart file upload)
  - `POST /ingest-pilot-doc/{doc_id}` (retroactive for hub_documents)
  - `GET /staging[?status=&customer_id=&limit=&skip=]`
  - `GET /staging/{id}`
  - `POST /staging/{id}/update`
  - `POST /staging/{id}/approve?approved_by=`
  - `POST /staging/{id}/reject?rejected_by=&reason=`
  - `GET /learning-summary`
- New collections: `inv_import_staging`, `inv_xls_learned_mappings` (indexes ensured at startup).
- Forecast rows route to `inv_incoming_supply` (planned); everything else to `inv_movements`.
- `effective_date` additive field on movements (never overrides `created_at`).

### Added — Phase D (Learning Loop)
- On approval, persists `{sender_domain, header_hash, column_map, classification, approval_count}`.
- Future ingests with matching `(sender_domain, header_hash)` auto-resolve via `source: "learned"` with conf = 0.80 + 0.03·approvals.
- `get_learning_summary` returns aggregates for AI Learning dashboard.

### Added — Phase E (UI)
- `frontend/src/pages/InventoryImportsPage.js` — full review/approval dashboard at `/inventory/imports`:
  - Status filter chips (pending_review / applied / rejected / all)
  - Upload button (.xlsx / .xls / .csv)
  - Learning summary strip (top senders by approval count)
  - Staging list with classification + map source pills
  - Side-drawer: classification signals, column map preview, first 80 rows, customer selector, Approve / Reject actions

### Verified
- `testing_agent_v3_fork` iteration 207: **20/20 backend tests passed, 0 issues.**
- Live smoke test on preview env:
  - Ingest: 3-row OpenOrders XLS → classified at 0.95 conf, mapped at 0.82 heuristic
  - Approval: 3 movements in `inv_movements` with `effective_date` preserved
  - Learning: second file from same domain → `source: "learned"` at 0.83 confidence
  - UI: Renders correctly with learning strip, staging list, and detail drawer
- Deploy instructions + backfill script in `/app/DEPLOY_INVENTORY_XLS.md`.

### Deferred
- Auto-stage from pilot mailbox ingestion (currently requires explicit `POST /ingest-pilot-doc/{id}` per doc, or the bulk backfill loop).
- Teams Adaptive Card webhook (user input still pending).
- P1 Phase 3 (policy extraction from server.py).



## [2026-04-17] Match-Tier Distribution Donut Chart

### Added
- **`GET /api/inside-sales-pilot/match-tier-distribution`** — aggregation endpoint returning match-tier buckets (`exact`, `scoped`, `fuzzy`, `live`, `no_match`, `no_ref`) + `by_entity_type` breakdown + overall `match_rate_pct`.
- **`MatchTierDonut` component** (pure-SVG, no chart library) — rendered at top of Inside Sales Pilot dashboard showing donut + color-coded legend. Serves as canary metric: a drop in the exact slice while fuzzy rises is an early warning of extraction / BC cache drift BEFORE the overall match rate changes.
- Lint clean. Backend smoke-tested (empty preview env returns zero-state correctly).

### Added — Inventory XLS Proposal
- **`/app/INVENTORY_XLS_PROPOSAL.md`** — 4-phase architecture for routing inventory-related `.xlsx`/`.xls` emails into the `inv_movements` ledger with pilot-style human-in-the-loop safety (Phase A classifier → B column mapping with LLM fallback → C staging + approval → D learning loop). Awaiting user scope decision (A only, A+B, or all four).



## [2026-04-17] P1 Phase 2 + Batch Enhancements

### Added — Order Match fuzzy tier
- `_check_order` in `services/bc_prod_validator.py` gains a final **fuzzy_normalized_search** tier (runs when `bc_customer_no` is null and ref is ≥6 chars). Searches `normalized_document_no`, `normalized_external_ref`, and regex on raw `bc_external_document_no` across `sales_order + posted_sales_invoice + posted_sales_shipment`.
- Diagnostic endpoint reports new `hit_via_fuzzy_normalized` bucket.

### Added — UI BC Match column on Inside Sales Pilot dashboard
- New column in Recent Pilot Documents table with color-coded `bc_entity_type` badge:
  - 🟢 Open SO · 🟡 Posted Inv · 🔵 Shipment · ⚪ no match
- Tier suffix: `~` for fuzzy, `c` for customer-scoped (tooltips on hover).
- Gives reviewers instant visibility into whether a doc matched an open order vs an already-posted invoice — a key pilot-safety signal.

### Added — Low-volume vendor gate
- `document_readiness_service.evaluate_and_persist` now counts prior non-duplicate docs for the vendor. Fewer than 5 → readiness downgrades `ready_auto_*` → `needs_review` with `warning_reason: low_volume_vendor`.
- Prevents first-time / rare vendors from auto-filing before training data exists.

### Added — BOL / Tracking / Carrier extraction on pilot docs
- `_extract_sales_fields` now captures `bol_number`, `tracking_number`, and `carrier` from the main pipeline onto `sales_pilot_extraction`.
- Pilot remains ingest-only — fields are persisted/displayable, NOT written to BC.

### Changed — P1 Phase 2: callers migrated to unified facade
- 8 call sites now import from `services.unified_validation_service` instead of directly:
  - `server.py` — intake readiness, gap-closer, PO retry (3 sites)
  - `server.py :: _run_pilot_enrichment` (done in Phase 1)
  - `routers/readiness.py` — `/evaluate/{doc_id}` + PO retry endpoint
  - `routers/inside_sales_pilot.py` — `/validate/{doc_id}` + re-extract loop
  - `services/inside_sales_pilot_service.py` — polling loop
  - `services/gap_closer_service.py` — re-evaluation loop
- Delegators (`run_bc_prod_validation`, `run_readiness`) are one-liners — zero behavior change.

### Verified
- `testing_agent_v3_fork` iteration 206: **22/22 backend tests passed, 0 issues**.
- Facade imports work, policy registry returns 4 policies with archive fallback.
- All pilot endpoints respond correctly; diagnostic reports new `hit_via_fuzzy_normalized` bucket.
- Low-volume gate (threshold=5) and BOL/tracking code paths verified via introspection.
- Fuzzy normalized tier verified present in `_check_order` with 6-char minimum.

### Deferred with user input required
- **Teams Adaptive Card webhook** — needs Azure AD app + Teams webhook URL + user sign-off on whether "Approve" should bypass the ingest-only pilot constraint.
- **P1 Phase 3 (full server.py policy extraction)** — 1000+ lines of behavioral migration. Needs dedicated session with full regression testing.
- **Evergreen multi-PO container allocation** — needs sample spreadsheet + schema clarification.



## [2026-04-17] P1 Refactor Started — Unified Validation + Policy Modules

### Added
- **`services/unified_validation_service.py`** — single canonical entry point for document validation. Exposes:
  - `validate_document(doc_id, policy_hint=None)` → orchestrates bc_prod + readiness + pilot_readiness per `POLICY_STAGES` table
  - Thin delegators `run_bc_prod_validation`, `run_readiness`, `run_pilot_readiness`
  - `POLICY_STAGES` map declaring which validation stages apply per doc_type
  - `_infer_policy_hint(doc)` auto-detects the right pipeline based on `inside_sales_pilot` + `doc_type`
- **`policies/` package** — pluggable policy modules (architectural review §2.3):
  - `policies/base.py` — `PolicyModule` ABC + `PolicyResult` dataclass
  - `policies/registry.py` — `register_policy`, `get_policy`, `list_policies`; fallback to archive policy
  - `policies/archive.py` — 30-line policy for unknowns / no-op doc types
  - `policies/warehouse.py` — BOL / shipment policy (thin wrapper, readiness-driven)
  - `policies/ap_invoice.py` — AP routing by readiness state
  - `policies/sales_order.py` — Pilot pilot_review enforcement + non-pilot readiness routing
  - All 4 policies auto-register on package import

### Changed
- **`server.py :: _run_pilot_enrichment`** now calls `validate_document(pid, policy_hint="pilot_sales")` instead of importing bc_prod_validator + pilot_readiness_review_service directly (first canary migration; behavior unchanged — same stages run in same order).

### Verified
- Lint clean across all new files.
- Registry correctly maps 14 doc_type strings → 4 policy modules.
- `get_policy("garbage")` falls back to archive (no silent drops).
- Policy `evaluate()` smoke test: pilot sales → `stage=pilot_review` with `hold_for_pilot_review` action (ingest-only constraint preserved).
- Backend starts cleanly with no new errors.

### Next migration steps (scheduled)
- Migrate remaining `validate_document_against_bc` / `evaluate_and_persist` direct callers (~30 sites across server.py, routers/readiness.py, routers/inside_sales_pilot.py) to the unified facade.
- Once call sites are consolidated, extract shared primitives (`field_completeness`, `entity_exists`, `po_match`, `amount_range`, `duplicate_risk`, `extraction_quality`) from the 5 readiness services into `unified_validation_service`.
- Extract doc_type branches from `server.py` (lines 2065-2438, 3333-3634) into policy modules fleshing out real logic (currently thin wrappers).



## [2026-04-17] BC Order Match Rate Restored (P0 Fix)

### Diagnosed
- **Root cause**: Reported 0/222 Order Match was stale data. Earlier `validate-all` runs skipped docs with existing `bc_prod_validation` and didn't use `force=true`, so pre-fix results persisted.
- **Confirmed**: `_check_order` query logic was functionally correct — diagnostic endpoint showed 42.1% live hit rate on the very first probe.

### Added
- `GET /api/inside-sales-pilot/diagnose-order-match` — read-only diagnostic endpoint reporting:
  - `cache_health` — total sales_order records + external-ref coverage
  - `extraction_health` — PO / order number coverage across pilot docs
  - `sample_matches` — per-doc trace of refs_tried, direct cache hits, `_check_order` result
  - `raw_cache_samples` — shape of `bc_external_document_no` values
  - `summary` — hit rate broken down by match method

### Changed
- `_check_order` (in `services/bc_prod_validator.py`) now cascades across 3 BC entity types:
  1. `sales_order` (open, preferred — unchanged behavior for already-matching docs)
  2. `posted_sales_invoice` (catches 6-digit posted order numbers like `109301`, `111092`)
  3. `posted_sales_shipment` (catches shipment / BOL / warehouse refs)
- Customer-scoped fallback extended to the same 3 entity types.
- `match_method` now includes entity-type suffix (e.g., `cache_multi_search:posted_sales_invoice`) for observability.

### Verified (prod VM)
- Post-fix: **58.8%** Order Match hit rate on 50-doc sample (20/34 docs with refs matched)
- 225 pilot docs re-validated with `force=true`, 0 errors, avg overall score = **34**
- Docs files: `/app/DIAGNOSE_ORDER_MATCH.md`, `/app/DEPLOY_ORDER_MATCH_FIX.md`



## [2026-03-25] Learned Dunnage Patterns Feature

### Added
- **Learned Dunnage Patterns** — AI service that learns dunnage/ancillary line associations from historical orders and auto-suggests them during Sales Order review
  - Backend: `order_line_patterns.py` pattern learning service with `get_suggested_lines()` and `learn_patterns_from_history()`
  - Backend: Preflight endpoint injects `suggested` lines with metadata (confidence, frequency, occurrences)
  - Frontend: `PatternSuggestions` component with "Add All" and per-line "Add" buttons
  - Frontend: Sparkle icon visual distinction for pattern-sourced lines in editable table
  - Demo: Batch PO Split seeds Giovanni glass jar dunnage patterns (pallets, tier sheets, top frames)
  - Fixed UOM-aware qty_ratio calculations for M (per 1000) quantities

### Changed
- `CreateBCSalesOrderPanel` wrapped with `forwardRef` for parent access to edited lines
- Pattern-sourced lines separated from PO lines at preflight load time (shown in Suggested Additions panel, not mixed into line table)

### Added — Energy Surcharge / Customer-Level Patterns
- **Customer-level patterns** (trigger_item="*") for items that appear across ALL orders for a customer (not tied to specific products)
- `learn_from_bc_posted_orders()` function: queries BC for posted sales invoices, identifies recurring line items above threshold (default 75% of last 10 orders)
- ENERGY surcharge auto-suggested for Giovanni: Qty 1 EA, Price $497.36 (editable), "seen in 80% of orders"
- Preflight endpoint auto-triggers BC history learning on first encounter
- Demo batch seed includes ENERGY pattern alongside existing dunnage patterns

### Added — Quantity Bounds Checking
- **Statistical bounds checking** (±2σ from historical mean) on PO line quantities
- `check_quantity_bounds()` function compares PO qty against historical stats per item per customer
- Preflight response includes `bounds_check` with `in_bounds` flag and violation details (item, expected range, deviation factor, severity)
- Out-of-bounds: document flagged with `bounds_alert: true`, `workflow_status: bounds_review`, `ready: false`
- Red "Quantity Out of Bounds — Review Required" banner with per-violation CRITICAL/WARNING badges
- "Approve & Submit to BC" button blocked ("Blocked — Qty Review Required")
- Queue shows "Bounds Review" red status and "QTY ALERT" badge
- Validation checklist includes "Quantity bounds check" item
- Demo seed: `qty_history` with mean, std_dev, min, max, sample_count per item


## [2026-03-16] SharePoint Folder Routing Feature

### Added
- **SharePoint Folder Routing Management Page** (`/sharepoint-routing`)
  - Folder tree visualization based on "Temp Folder Structure 9.15.25.docx"
  - Vendor-to-folder mapping CRUD (31 default mappings)
  - Processor assignment management (Andy, Ellie, Meg, Rhonda, Aaron)
  - Interactive test routing tool
  - Re-seed defaults functionality

- **Backend Router** (`/api/sharepoint-routing/*`)
  - Full CRUD for folder rules, vendor mappings, processor assignments
  - Document folder suggestion endpoint
  - Document folder assignment and move-to-SharePoint endpoints
  - Batch suggest and batch move operations
  - Auto-seeding of default configuration on first access

- **Folder Routing Service** (updated `folder_routing_service.py`)
  - Complete routing logic matching the accounting folder structure
  - Priority-based rules: Canpack override -> Credit Memos -> Tooling -> Freight -> S&H -> Standard
  - Vendor pattern matching for Ball, Canpack, Anchor, OI, freight carriers
  - International/domestic routing
  - Warehouse subfolder routing (Assembly, GT's, Ball Orders, UPS Orders, etc.)

- **AI Classification Enhancement**
  - Updated Gemini prompt with SharePoint routing context
  - Added extraction of routing fields: is_international, is_tooling, is_storage_handling, is_credit_memo, is_dunnage, freight_direction
  - Return_Request classification updated for credit memos

- **Document Pipeline Integration**
  - Auto-compute SharePoint folder suggestion after document classification
  - Store `sharepoint_folder_suggested` and `sharepoint_folder_reason` on hub_documents
  - Display folder suggestion in document detail page with breadcrumb path

- **Document Detail "Move to SharePoint" Button**
  - "Get Folder Suggestion" button when no folder suggestion exists
  - "Move to SharePoint" one-click button after folder is suggested
  - Shows folder path breadcrumbs, routing reason, and move timestamp
  - Both buttons integrated directly in the SharePoint card on document detail page

### Fixed
- **P0: Multi-Page PDF Misclassification** - Root cause: entire multi-page PDF was sent to Gemini, causing shipping content from later pages to overwhelm the classification. Fix: extract first page only using pypdf for classification of multi-page PDFs.
- **Regression: Purchase Invoice Line Items Missing in BC** - Root cause: `create_purchase_invoice_from_document` created the PI header but never called `add_purchase_invoice_lines` to add line items. Fix: added `add_purchase_invoice_lines` function to `gpi_integration_service.py` (mirrors `add_sales_order_lines` pattern) and integrated it into the PI creation flow. Lines are now extracted from `extracted_fields.line_items` and sent via `purchaseInvoices({id})/purchaseInvoiceLines` standard BC API. Frontend updated to show lines_added/lines_total/line_errors.

### Dependencies Added
- `pypdf` - For extracting first page of multi-page PDFs

### Test Results
- Backend: 20/20 tests passed (100%)
- Frontend: 12/12 UI tests passed (100%)
- Test report: `/app/test_reports/iteration_123.json`
